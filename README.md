## About this document

If you start working with a new person, wouldn’t it be nice if you had some sort of user guide that gives you a basic understanding of how to work with them? This document is exactly that. It captures my guiding principles, how I work as a human and what I value in others.


It’s meant as a frame of reference and a starting point for discussions. Hopefully, it will help you understand me better and allow us to work together in a more meaningful way. If you have a similar document, I’d love to see it.

Inevitably, I will sometimes fail to live up to my own ideals. I will always try, and they are here so you can hold me accountable. If you’re not a fan of manuals, that’s fine too, we can figure things out as we go.

This is a living document, incomplete and imperfect. I will update it regularly and would [appreciate your feedback](https://github.com/Thenavigo/Feedback)


## My premises

Things I believe to be true, that are the foundation of us working together.

<b>We trust each other</b>: Whatever you do, I will assume good intent. I trust that you know what you’re doing and that you will let me know when you need my help. I hope you treat me the same way.

<br />

<b>We’re better together</b>: We wouldn’t be here, working together, if one of us could do it on their own. We bring different skills and viewpoints to the table, and it’s our job to make the best use of all of them.


<br />

<b>We have the same goal</b>: We can’t be successful together if we’re aiming for different outcomes. If one of us feels our goals or motives aren’t aligned, we need to talk.

<br />

<b>We support one another</b>: If there is anything that prevents you from doing your best work, let me know. If it’s something related to me, I will try to fix it. If it’s beyond us, we will try and find a solution together. If it’s a personal matter, I will try to cover for you. That also means…

<br />

<b>We win together, we fail together</b>: People who like to claim credit and assign blame are a major turnoff for me.

<br />

## What I value

<b>Context-awareness<b>. Nothing that we do happens in a vacuum. In fact, making the right decisions is foremost about understanding the context we’re operating in. This can be anything from interpersonal to organisation-wide, from understanding customer needs to market forces and policy constraints.
