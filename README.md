## About this document

If you start working with a new person, wouldn’t it be nice if you had some sort of user guide that gives you a basic understanding of how to work with them? This document is exactly that. It captures my guiding principles, how I work as a human and what I value in others.


It’s meant as a frame of reference and a starting point for discussions. Hopefully, it will help you understand me better and allow us to work together in a more meaningful way. If you have a similar document, I’d love to see it.

Inevitably, I will sometimes fail to live up to my own ideals. I will always try, and they are here so you can hold me accountable. If you’re not a fan of manuals, that’s fine too, we can figure things out as we go.

This is a living document, incomplete and imperfect. I will update it regularly and would [appreciate your feedback](https://github.com/Thenavigo/Feedback)
